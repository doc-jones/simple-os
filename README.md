# Simple OS 

A freestanding Rust binary upon which OS abstractions can be built.

## Initial Setup

1. Make sure that you're running the `nightly` version of the Rust compiler. If
you're unsure if you have `rustup` installed or not, you can install it from 
[here][rustup-download]. Once that's done, run `rustup toolchain install nightly`
to install the `nightly` toolchain, then switch to it by running `rustup default
nightly`.
2. Fork the repo, then clone it onto your local machine.
3. Download and install [QEMU][qemu-download], which is the virtual environment 
we'll be running our OS in (you may need to add it to your path). You can check 
that QEMU was correctly installed by running `qemu-system-x86_64` and making sure
an empty window QEMU window pops up.
4. `cd` into the root of the `simple-os` project.
5. We'll need to add Rust's `core` and `compiler_builtins` libraries locally. Do
this by running `rustup component add rust-src`. 
6. We'll need to install some additional prerequisites through `cargo`, namely the
`bootimage` and `llvm-tools-preview` dependencies. You can add these by running 
`cargo install bootimage` and `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`. 
7. Run `cargo build` to see if everything compiles without issue.
8. Run `cargo run`. If everything is working correctly, a QEMU window should pop
up with `"Hello World!"` printed inside of it.
9. Run `cargo test`. The output should include, among other things, five passing
tests that look like the following:

```
simple_os::vga_buffer::test_println_simple...   [ok]
simple_os::vga_buffer::test_println_many...   [ok]
simple_os::vga_buffer::test_println_output...   [ok]
simple_os::vga_buffer::test_println...   [ok]
should_panic::should_fail...   [ok]
```

If you see these statements in your `cargo test` output, then everything worked, 
and you should be good to go! If you see something different, reach out and let me know
so we can look into it.
